This is a screenshot of the first screen. This screen includes a text view so that the user can identify why the app is not allowing you to add to playlist. This only happens when the all the fiels arent filled in. It also tells you when the details of the song are addded to the playlist. The fields are at the top of the screen, in total there are 4 fields. Bellow the text view there are 3 buttons, one to add to playlist, the next to view the playlist and lastly to exit the app
